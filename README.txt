Leejia James

Tasks attempted:
1. Given an array A of integers, and an integer X, find how many pairs of
   elements of A sum to X
   Program Name: HowMany.java

2. Given an array A, return an array B that has those elements of A that
   occur exactly once, in the same order in which they appear in A
   Program Name: ExactlyOnce.java

3. Given an array A of integers, find the length of a longest streak of
   consecutive integers that occur in A (not necessarily contiguously)
   Program Name: LongestStreak.java

How to Compile:
1. Unzip contents of lxj171130.zip into a folder named "lxj171130".
